# ShellSort vs BubbleSort Execution Time Evaluation

## Language: Java
## IDE: IntelliJ
This program tests the ShellSort and BubbleSort algorithms in various capacities.

### Main Functions To Know
- ShellSort(T[] data}
- BubbleSort(T[] data)
- BubbleSort2(T[] data)
Note: BubbleSort2 is an improved algorithm of BubbleSort that kicks out when a swap does not happen.

### Tests Run
- Random Unsorted Array of size 10, 100, 1000
- Random Sorted Array of size 10, 100, 1000
Note: Adjustable MAX_INTEGER value (most tests were run using 100 as value)

#### Output
- Time it takes to run the algorithm using System.nanoTime()
- Amount of swaps and comparisons made by each algorithm and displaying the updated Arrays as they're sorted.

#### Output Example:
